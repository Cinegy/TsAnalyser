#Cinegy TS Analyser Tool

Use this tool to view inbound network, RTP and TS packet details.

##How easy is it?

Well, we've added everything you need into a single teeny-tiny EXE again, which just depends on .NET 4. And then we gave it all a nice Apache license, so you can tinker and throw the tool wherever you need to on the planet.

Just run the EXE from inside a command-prompt, and a handy help message will pop up like this:

##Command line arguments:

Double click, or just run without (or with incorrect) arguments, and you'll see this:

  --help                    Display this help screen.

Because most of the time you might want a quick-and-dirty scan of a stream, if you just double-click the EXE (or run without arguments) it will ask you interactively what multicast address and group you want to listen to - perfect for people that hate typing!

Even better, just to make your life easier, we auto-build this using AppVeyor - here is how we are doing right now:
